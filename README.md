Instant pair programming, just add web!
=======

Run like this:

```
$ pairjs MY-COOL-DIRECTORY
```

Then go here:

http://localhost:8000/edit/afile.txt

The file will be saved in that directory. Files are collaboratively edited using [ShareJS](http://sharejs.org). Existing files are loaded from the disk when the program runs.
